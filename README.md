This code was used to analyze data for the Khan et al., 2024 JNeurosci paper.

Individual subject data were analyzed using AllPowerAnalysis.m. To divide channels into rostral and caudal, the Coordinates struct was used to stratify them based on their y-coordinate in RostralCaudalChanSelection.m. Using these scripts requires changing the path in the LoadInfoFile.m function. Figures.m contains code for statistical analyses for the main findings of the paper. MVPA_WithinFreq_step1.m and *_step2.m were the scripts used to perform MVPA and statistical analyses for MVPA (adapted from Wendiggensen et al., 2023).
